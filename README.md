# CampusOutfitRandomiser
A small tool for assisting those like me who like treasure hunting as they go around campus. The tool gives you a particular outsit that you will search for on your campus as you look for people to share the gospel with.

👕 Campus Outfit Randomiser
Feeling stuck on what to wear to campus? The Campus Outfit Randomiser is a fun and simple web application designed to help you quickly choose an outfit. With just a click, you can generate a new look and even get a little daily inspiration!
